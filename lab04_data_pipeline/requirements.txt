src: keeps logic testable (no side effects on import).
scripts: a single entrypoint to run end-to-end (for you & CI).
tests: pytest will discover these easily.
data/outputs: runtime artifacts so CI can store them; add to .gitignore.

- numpy & pandas (data + math)
- matplotlib (save plots to file, headless friendly)
- pytest (tests)
