## Calendar Printer â€” lab05

# What this script does
1) Asks the user:
   - How many days are in the month (e.g., 30)
   - Which weekday the month starts on (e.g., 'Mon' or 1 if Sunday=0)

2) Prints a simple month view in the terminal with one week per line.
   Header must be: S M T W T F S  (weeks start on Sunday)

# Teaching notes
- We keep *logic* (pure functions) separate from *I/O* (input/print).
- This makes it easier to test (see tests/test_calendar_printer.py).
